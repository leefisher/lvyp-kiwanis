              The Kiwanis Club of Las Vegas, Young Professionals (LVYP Kiwanis)
              was established in 2008. Though we have the words “young
              professionals” in our name, we welcome all potential members to
              the club. As we like to say, “we are for any member who is young,
              or young at heart.” Unlike many traditional Kiwanis clubs, our
              group meets once a month during a service project. Once a month,
              we also meet in a more formal setting with our general meeting.
              Our members want to be involved in a lot of hands-on service so we
              pride ourselves on the service projects we participate in and the
              service leadership programs that we help to guide.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
              Kiwanis helps kids around the world. Local clubs look out for our
              communities and the international organization takes on
              large-scale challenges, such as fighting disease and poverty.
              Service is at the heart of every Kiwanis club, no matter where in
              the world it’s located.

            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-2">
              For more than a century, Kiwanis has created opportunities for
              children to be curious, safe and healthy regardless of the
              community in which they live. When you give a child the chance to
              learn, experience, dream, grow, succeed and thrive, great things
              can happen.
