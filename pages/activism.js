                  STATEMENT ON RACIAL JUSTICE
                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
                  In these recent weeks of grief, anger, fear, and uncertainty
                  regarding the state of racial justice in our communities, it
                  is important for our club to ensure our support for the Black
                  Lives Matter movement and all efforts to fight against racial
                  injustice in our community. LVYP Kiwanis has prided itself in
                  its diversity and commitment to the community for over a
                  decade in the Las Vegas Community. Following the death of
                  George Floyd, our club understood that it was not just that
                  one incident, but another example in a history of racial and
                  prejudicial injustice against the Black community. As a
                  community organization, we want to make sure our members and
                  allies are informed of resources available to them in the Las
                  Vegas community and beyond. Only as a COMMUNITY can we make
                  the positive steps toward a more inclusive and just society.
                  We stand with those who have been victims of racial injustice
                  and offer a supporting voice and hand to those who need it.
                  With hope and support, Kiwanis Club of Las Vegas, Young

                <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">
                  Homelessness is a large issue in southern Nevada. Homeless
                  youth encounter even more obstacles in regard to their
                  personal safety and well-being. We are fortunate to get to
                  support this population through working with an organization
                  like the Nevada Partnership for Homeless Yough. More
